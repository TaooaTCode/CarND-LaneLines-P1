The Project
---
Open the code in a Jupyter Notebook

`> jupyter notebook`

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.  Click on the file called "P1.ipynb".  Another browser window will appear displaying the notebook. 

The program takes in test images and videos under /test_images and /test_videos folders. The output videos with the detected lane lines overlayed on the orginal videos are stored under the /test_videos_output folder.
